A classifier algorythm is composed of two parts

- the general schema is the same for every classifier
- the parameters are learned through examples

How do we evaluate the performance of our model?

- we can subdivide the data set in
- a training set
- a testing set

...

even the best position of the straight line misclassifies some points

- this decision function is limited

also, problem of generalization

- the perfect function for a dataset would not be suitable for new data

One of the main tradeoffs for machine learning is to balance the classification with generalization

- the more parameters our model has, the less general it is with other data
- a good idea is to start with simple models
- and then complicate as necessary
