in some way outliar detection is a kind of classification

- it's also callend one-class classification

ritorna la curse of dimensionality

- the space is very sparse (not densely populated)
- so distances tend to be similar

intrusion detection is the primary use case of outliar detection

...

is this a supervised or an unsupervised task?

- it can be both
- of course if we have labelled examples of outliars its better (we only have the problem of unbalanceness)
- in most cases we're in an unsupervised setting
